    <p> Last game recap:</p>
    <p> The blazers took that W to the knicks. Dame played well scoring 32 on 10 of 20 from the field. Dame also had 5 assists. Pretty rough game for C.J putting up only 12 points on 4 of 15 from the field. Nurk put up 12 points, 9 boards, and 6 assists. ET came off the bench contributing 10 points. The Knicks were never really in the game and the blazers won by a final score of 103-91.The blazers got 4 of 5 on that road trip. <p>
